## PROBLEM STATEMENT
I have chosen this project because nowadays there are lots of people trying to fool you just by sending you fake e-mails like you have won a 1000 dollars, this much amount is deposited in your account once you open this link and then they will try to hack your information.

1. Unwanted emails irritating internet consumers.
2. Critical e-mail messages are missed and/or delayed.
3. Identity Theft.
4. Spam can crash mail servers and fill up hard drive.
5. Billions of dollars lost worldwide.

To answer these kindly view the Spam Mail Prediction Jupyter Notebook, there I have mentioned step by step guide.
